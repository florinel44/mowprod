    <p>Formed back in 2020 by a group of like-minded creatives, Studioset has finally come of age. Like any good wine, the taste has become full bodied and boasts a sophisticated bouquet, the studio becoming one of Bucharest’s leading production houses today. But any experienced sommelier talks about good old bottles, rather than good old vintages. Because it’s the bottle that counts – the environment in which the wine is matured. And Studioset has always strived to be a place that attracts, nurtures and promotes creativity. Whether it’s commercial, branded content, film, music video, VR or any other format, we aim for complexity and character, championing creativity. We present a selection of directors from the experienced to up-and-coming, and together with our in-house facilities – 7 edit bays, 2 sound studios and a complete VFX  / Animation / Compositing department we can refine a successful project from its conception to completion, always sure to leave you with a rich and flavourful finish. Clients that come to Romania with a palate trained for something different have been pleasantly surprised by our location services, a branch of the company that we are steadily developing. So, don’t take our word for it, browse through our site and have a taste! </p>
